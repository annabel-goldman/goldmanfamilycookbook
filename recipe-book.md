  Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Toffee Cookies Annabel Goldman
 INGREDIENTS
2 sticks unsalted butter
2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1⁄2 tsp. Morton kosher salt
1 cup dark brown sugar
1⁄3 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature 2 tsp. vanilla extract

11⁄2 cups chocolate chips

3.While the butter is browning, whisk together flour, baking soda, and kosher salt.
4.Transfer the butter to a large bowl and pop into the freezer and allow to cool until warm to the touch. 5. Add the brown and granulated sugar. Blend until
