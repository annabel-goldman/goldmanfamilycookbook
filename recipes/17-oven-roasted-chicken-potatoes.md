## Directions

1. Let the chicken sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours before cooking. Remove gizzards, rinse the chicken, and pat dry thoroughly.
2. Preheat the oven to broil at 500-550°F.
3. Coat the chicken evenly with olive oil and season generously with kosher salt, pepper, and other spices as desired.
4. Peel and chop potatoes, toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
5. Arrange potatoes in a single layer in a baking pan.
6. Place the chicken on a tray above the potatoes.
7. Broil the chicken, breast side up, for 10 minutes, then flip and lower the oven to 400°F (350°F for convection).
8. Continue roasting for about 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
9. Let the chicken rest after removing from the oven. If needed, broil potatoes further for extra crispiness.
10. Serve the chicken and potatoes, garnished with parsley or lemon if desired.
