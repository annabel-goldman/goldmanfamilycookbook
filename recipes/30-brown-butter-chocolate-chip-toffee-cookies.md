**Recipe by Annabel Goldman**

---

## Ingredients

- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp Morton kosher salt
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 (1.4-oz) chocolate toffee bars (preferably Skor), chopped into ¼" pieces
- 1½ cups chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir until it foams, then browns (5–8 minutes).
3. While the butter is browning, whisk together flour, baking soda, and kosher salt.
4. Transfer the butter to a large bowl and pop into the freezer and allow to cool until warm to the touch.
5. Add the brown and granulated sugar. Blend until combined (about 1 minute).
6. Add eggs and vanilla extract. Mix until the mixture lightens (about 1 minute).
7. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined.
8. Fold in chocolate and toffee. For best results allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. The dough will initially appear loose but will thicken over time.
9. Form balls of dough, and place onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle each ball with salt (do not flatten).
10. Bake for 9–11 minutes, or until edges are golden but centers remain soft.
