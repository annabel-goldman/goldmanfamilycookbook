- 1 pound fresh kale
- ½ medium red onion
- ¼ cup sunflower seeds
- ¼ cup pumpkin seeds
- ¼ cup sesame seeds

## Directions

1. In a bowl, whisk together the Bragg's Liquid Amino Acids (or soy sauce) and lemon juice. Gradually add the olive oil, continuing to whisk until well combined.
2. Slice the red onion into small half-moons and marinate in the prepared dressing.
3. In a heavy skillet over medium heat, toast the sunflower, pumpkin, and sesame seeds separately until they are fragrant and lightly browned.
4. Remove the stems from the kale, stack the leaves, and slice them into ¼ inch ribbons. Place the ribbons in a large salad bowl.
5. Add the toasted seeds to the kale. Toss with the marinated onions and desired amount of dressing. Be cautious not to overdress.
6. Gently massage the dressing into the kale with your hands. This step is crucial for softening the kale.
7. Dice the avocado and add it to the salad along with the sprouts (if using). Toss gently to combine.
