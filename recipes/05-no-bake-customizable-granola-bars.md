## Directions

1. In a bowl, mix together the oats and rice crispy cereal.
2. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, combine butter, syrup, and brown sugar. Cover with a paper towel and microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Be cautious as the syrup will be very hot.
3. Stir in the vanilla and salt into the syrup mixture.
4. Pour the syrup mixture over the oats and stir thoroughly with a rubber scraper until well mixed. Add in your chosen flavorings/mix-ins.
5. Place the mixture on waxed paper. Using the waxed paper, wrap the granola tightly to form a square shape. Put it in a plastic bag labeled with your name.
6. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
7. Cut into your preferred size before serving.
