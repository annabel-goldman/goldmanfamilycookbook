# Oven Baked Bread Crumb Mac and Cheese

**Recipe by Rob Goldman & Anita Marcus**

---

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Box of pasta
- Bread crumbs
- Salt and pepper
- 8-12 oz shredded cheese (typically sharp cheddar)

---

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. In a medium saucepan over low-medium heat, melt the butter. Add flour and stir until combined.
3. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring continuously.
4. Slowly add the shredded cheese to the saucepan, continually stirring.
5. Add salt, continuing to stir. The mixture will thicken, and cheese may appear stringy. Maintain the heat and keep stirring until smooth.
6. In a separate pot, boil and drain the pasta.
7. Combine the drained pasta with the cheese sauce, stirring to coat evenly.
8. Transfer to a baking dish. Season with additional salt and pepper, and sprinkle breadcrumbs on top.
9. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes or until golden brown on top. Enjoy!
