**Recipe by Sheila Hudson**

---

## Ingredients

- 1 pound butter
- 4 and one bit cups flour
- 1 cup sugar

---

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
2. In a mixer, cream together butter and sugar until well combined and smooth.
3. Gradually add flour to the creamed mixture, mixing slowly to ensure an even blend. Continue until the mixture becomes crumbly.
4. Transfer the dough to a jellyroll pan. Gently spread it to an even thickness.
5. Delicately prick the surface of the dough with a fork, without piercing through, to let the deal ooot (to get the devil out).
6. Lightly sprinkle sugar over the dough for added sweetness and texture.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the shortbread is lightly golden.
8. Once slightly cooled but still warm, cut the shortbread into traditional finger-sized pieces.
9. To enhance the flavor, sing traditional songs such as "Scotland the Brave" while preparing the shortbread.
