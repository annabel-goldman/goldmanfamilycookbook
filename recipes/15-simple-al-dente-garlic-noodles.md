## Directions

1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the noodles. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Once cooked, drain the noodles and set aside.
2. While the noodles are cooking, heat a small amount of olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped garlic to the oil, and fry gently. Season with a little salt, being careful not to let the garlic burn.
3. Add the drained noodles to the pan with the garlic. Toss the noodles in the garlic and oil until evenly coated. Annabel recommends seasoning with chili flakes and lemon salt for an extra kick.
4. Serve the garlic noodles hot, either as a main dish or a flavorful side.

## Notes

This recipe was the first time Annabel tried pasta that had anything other than butter and salt. She was so inclined because of the smell created while cooking this dish. If you're with anyone else prepare to make an extra serving because everyone will come running for a taste.
