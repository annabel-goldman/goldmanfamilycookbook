**Recipe by Bruce Stephens**

---

## Ingredients

- 1 large bag of Oreo Cookies, finely crushed (preferably frozen before crushing)

- 2¾ cups milk
- 12 oz container of Cool Whip
- Gummy worms for garnish

## Directions

1. Using a blender or food processor, finely crush the Oreo cookies. It's easier if the cookies are frozen beforehand.
2. In a mixing bowl, blend the softened cream cheese with powdered sugar until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, prepare the vanilla pudding using 2¾ cups of milk. Once done, add it to the cream cheese mixture.
4. Gently fold in the Cool Whip into the pudding and cream cheese mixture until well combined.
5. Place a few Oreo crumbs at the bottom of individual serving cups. Spoon the pudding mixture over the crumbs.
6. Sprinkle a few more Oreo crumbs on top of the pudding mixture. Place a gummy worm on top of each cup for a fun and playful presentation.
