## Ingredients

- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (or equivalent amount of cutlets)
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 1 large egg
- 2 tbsp mustard
- ⅓ cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- ⅓ cup breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp canola oil
- Fresh parsley, for garnish
- Lemon wedges, for garnish and flavor
- Butter lettuce, for display

## Directions

1. Pound the chicken breasts or cutlets flat and cut into small pieces (around 2 inches x 4 inches, or whatever size you prefer).
2. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.
3. In a bowl, beat together the egg and the mustard.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs and mix them well.
5. Dip chicken pieces into the egg/mustard mixture, and then roll them in the breadcrumb/cheese mixture. Set them aside for a few minutes to set. (You can use wax paper to hold the pieces.)
6. Heat the oil on medium/high.
7. Sauté the chicken pieces in the oil for 12-15 minutes or until they are cooked through (i.e., no longer pink on the inside).
8. Arrange the chicken on butter lettuce wedges.
9. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on the chicken for flavor (as desired).
10. Garnish the chicken with lemon and parsley.
