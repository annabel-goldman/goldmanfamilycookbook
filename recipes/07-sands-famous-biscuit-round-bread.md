**Recipe by Hank Goldman**

---

## Ingredients

- Non-stick bundt pan
- Butter for greasing
- 2 cans Pillsbury Grands Flaky Biscuits
- Additional butter (for drizzling)

---

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven according to the instructions on the Pillsbury Grands Flaky Biscuits package.
2. Grease the bundt pan thoroughly with butter to ensure easy release of the bread after baking.
3. Open the cans of Pillsbury Grands Flaky Biscuits. Separate the biscuits and slice each biscuit into pieces approximately ½ inch thick.
4. Arrange the biscuit pieces evenly around the bundt pan, placing them vertically to create a round shape.
5. Drizzle additional butter over the top of the biscuit pieces in the pan. This will give the bread a delicious, buttery crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven according to the package instructions. Be sure to watch carefully to prevent burning.
7. Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before inverting onto a serving plate.
