**Recipe by Kristin Hudson**

- 8 slices bacon, chopped
- ¼ cup maple syrup
- 1 sheet puff pastry
- 1 wheel Brie cheese

- Bread (for serving)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain excess fat. Add maple syrup, stirring to combine.
3. Roll out the puff pastry on the prepared baking sheet. Place the Brie wheel in the center and spoon over the maple-bacon mixture, reserving 1-2 tablespoons.
4. Fold each corner of the puff pastry towards the center, brushing each with the egg wash to secure.
5. Sprinkle the pastry with pecans and drizzle the remaining maple-bacon mixture on top.
6. Bake until the puff pastry turns golden. If the pastry is browning too quickly, cover with foil.
7. Once baked, serve immediately with slices of bread.
