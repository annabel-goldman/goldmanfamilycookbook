# Toasted Almond Onion Brussel Sprouts

**Recipe by Kristin Hudson**

---

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh brussel sprouts, cut in half
- 4-6 tablespoons butter
- ½ onion, chopped
- Salt and pepper
- 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon
- ¼ cup slivered almonds

---

## Directions

1. Parboil the brussel sprouts by bringing 2 quarts of water and 1 tbsp of salt to a boil. Add the brussels sprouts and parboil them for 3 minutes until just tender. (Or steam them if you prefer.) They should be cooked all the way through but still quite firm and bright green in color.
2. Sauté the onions in 2-3 tablespoons of butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Cook until they are translucent (about 4-5 minutes).
3. Add 2-3 tablespoons of butter and the brussel sprouts to the onions. Sauté until the brussel sprouts begin to caramelize.
4. Toast the almonds.
5. Stir in the lemon juice and add the toasted almonds. Salt and pepper to taste.

## Notes

This recipe is a classic staple in the Goldman household. Annabel prefers the more toasted, dark and crispy Brussels, while other members of the family prefer a more golden brown color on their brussel sprouts.
