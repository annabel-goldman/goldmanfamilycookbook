## Directions

1. Take prime rib out of the fridge 1 hour before cooking, season with salt, and let it sit at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap.
2. Preheat oven to 500°F, adjusting the rack for center placement.
3. Mix 1½ teaspoons salt, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and olive oil in a bowl.
4. Dry the roast with paper towels, then evenly apply the seasoning. Place bone-in roasts bones down in the skillet, or use a rack for boneless.
5. Roast at 500°F for 15 minutes, then lower to 325°F, continuing to roast. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness:
   - **Rare:** 120°F
   - **Medium Rare:** 130°F
   - **Medium:** 140°F
   - **Medium Well:** 150°F
6. Remove 5-10 degrees before desired doneness.
7. After removing from the oven, tent with foil and rest for 30 minutes.
8. Carve into ½ inch slices and serve with horseradish.
