## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, pie spice, white sugar, and salt.
3. Lightly spray a large muffin tin with cooking spray.
4. Put the dry ingredients into a 2-cup liquid measuring cup.
5. In a separate 1-cup liquid measuring cup, add brown sugar, vegetable oil, egg, vanilla, and your choice of pumpkin or applesauce.
6. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently. Remember, do not overmix! The batter should be lumpy.
7. Pour all the batter into the large muffin tin, scraping the cup to use all the batter.
8. Place the muffin tin on a baking sheet and bake for 20-22 minutes, or until the top springs back when touched.
9. Optionally, dust the top with powdered sugar after baking.
