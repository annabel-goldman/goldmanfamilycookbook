**Recipe by Bruce Stephens**

## Ingredients

- 1 lb lean ground beef
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 6 slices bacon, diced
- 2 cans (approx. 16 oz each) baked beans, liquid reserved
- 1 can (15 oz) red kidney beans, drained
- 1 can (15 oz) lima beans, drained
- ¼ cup molasses
- ½ to ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 2 tsp yellow mustard

## Directions

1. **Brown the Meat:** In a skillet, brown the ground beef with the diced bacon and chopped onion until the beef is cooked through and the bacon is crispy.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** Transfer the browned meat mixture to a slow cooker. Add the baked beans (with liquid reserved), red kidney beans, lima beans, molasses, brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard.
3. **Slow Cook:** Stir all ingredients together in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour. Then, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for 3 to 5 hours. If the mixture becomes too thick, add some of the reserved baked bean liquid to thin it to your desired consistency.
4. **Alternative Cooking Methods:** Alternatively, you can simmer the beans on the stovetop for 1 hour or bake them in a 350°F oven for 1 hour.
