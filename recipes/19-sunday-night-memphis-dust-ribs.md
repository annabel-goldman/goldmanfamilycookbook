## Ingredients

### For the Rub
- ¾ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ cup American paprika
- ¼ cup garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons ground ginger powder
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons rosemary powder

### For the Ribs
- Rack of ribs
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons rub (from above)
- Water (for moisture)

## Directions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine all rub ingredients until well-blended. Set aside.
2. Preheat your oven or grill to 225°F.
3. Carefully remove the membrane from the back of the ribs to allow for better seasoning penetration.
4. Season each side of the ribs with about a teaspoon of kosher salt. Ensure thicker parts receive slightly more salt.
5. Apply 1 tablespoon of the prepared rub to the front and another tablespoon to the back of the ribs, ensuring even coverage.
6. Place the ribs in the oven or on the grill. For added moisture and to prevent drying out, place a tray of water beneath the ribs.
7. Cook the ribs at a low temperature for approximately 5 hours. Avoid frequent checking; limit to once or twice during the cooking process.
8. Using tongs, lift the ribs. If they bend as though they might break, they're done. If they remain firm, allow more cooking time.
