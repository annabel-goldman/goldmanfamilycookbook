## Notes

This recipe is one of Bruce, Glady, Andy and Chance's favorite recipes! It also incorporates two of Annabel's favorite things, broccoli and bacon and one of Rob's favorite things—sunflower seeds! Susan is also a fan of raisins which are featured in this recipe (at least those within raisin bran).
