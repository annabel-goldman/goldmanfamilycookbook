## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Prepare a 9x13 inch jelly roll pan by greasing and flouring it lightly.
2. In a 2-quart saucepan, melt the margarine and unsweetened chocolate over low heat. Once melted, remove the pan from the stove.
3. Stir in the sugar until well combined.
4. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition.
5. Mix in the vanilla extract and salt.
6. Gradually blend in the flour until just combined. If using nuts, fold them into the batter.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan.
10. Once cooled, prepare the Jiffy frosting mix according to package instructions and frost the brownies.
