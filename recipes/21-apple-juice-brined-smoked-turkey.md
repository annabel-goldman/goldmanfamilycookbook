## Directions

1. In a large container, whisk together apple juice, salt, brown sugar, and molasses until dissolved. Stir in ice cold water. Submerge turkey, breast side down, in brine. Refrigerate for 12 hours.
2. Combine paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, black pepper, onion powder, thyme, oregano, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl.
3. Remove turkey from brine and pat dry. Gently separate skin from meat and spread about 1½ tablespoons of rub under the breast and thigh skin. Sprinkle remaining rub all over the turkey, inside and out. Place a knob of butter under the skin for added moisture.
4. Preheat smoker or grill to 325°F, adding smoking wood when at temperature. Drink or empty ⅓ of the beer can and place it on the smoker. Carefully lower turkey onto the beer can, ensuring it stands vertically. Cover and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 160°F in the breast, about 2 to 3 hours.
5. Remove turkey from smoker and let rest for 20-30 minutes. Remove beer can, carve, and serve.
