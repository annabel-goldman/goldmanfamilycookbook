## Directions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve the Jell-O in 1 cup boiling water.
2. Add the strawberries with juice and drained crushed pineapple. Stir to blend.
3. Pour half of the Jell-O mixture into a 9" x 13" glass dish. Spread evenly and chill until set.
4. Once set, gently spread the sour cream over the Jell-O layer. Stir the sour cream beforehand to achieve a smoother consistency.
5. Pour the remaining Jell-O mixture over the sour cream layer, spread evenly, cover, and chill until set.
6. The Jell-O can be served in squares or family style.

## Notes

A strawberry Jell-O mold has been a dessert staple at many holiday gatherings in Iowa. While we were unable to locate the original recipe, this family cookbook would be incomplete without some sort of Jell-O mold included! For this reason this recipe is grandma inspired.
