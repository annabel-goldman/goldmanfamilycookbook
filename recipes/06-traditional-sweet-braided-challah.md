## Directions

1. Dissolve 1 package of yeast in 1 cup of warm water (110-115°F) in a room temperature bowl. Add sugar and let stand for 5 minutes until yeast bubbles.
2. Mix in 1 egg, oil, salt, and vanilla (optional).
3. Gradually add flour, one cup at a time, mixing well. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed.
4. Form dough into a ball, lightly oil, cover, and let rise for at least 1 hour (or refrigerate overnight for a slow rise). The dough should double or triple in size.
5. After rising, punch down and knead briefly. Divide into 3 or 4 sections, roll into long shapes, and braid.
6. Make an egg wash (1 egg mixed with water and optional sugar), and apply to the braided dough. Add toppings if desired.
7. Let braided dough rise again until puffy, but before it starts to flatten.
8. Preheat oven to 350°F.
9. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 200°F.
