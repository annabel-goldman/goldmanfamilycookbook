**Recipe by Gabrielle Goldman**

---

## Ingredients

- 2 large lemons
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 ounces each), pounded to ½-inch thickness
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large shallot, trimmed, peeled, and minced
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons brined capers, rinsed and drained
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, minced

## Directions

1. Slice one lemon half into ⅛-inch slices and juice the rest to yield ¼ cup juice. Set aside.
2. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour, shaking off excess.
3. In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook two chicken cutlets until golden brown on each side (3-4 minutes per side), then transfer to a plate and cover with foil. Repeat with remaining cutlets.
4. In the same skillet, sauté minced shallot until fragrant (1-2 minutes). Add chicken broth and lemon slices, increase heat, and simmer until reduced to ⅓ cup (7-9 minutes).
5. Add lemon juice and capers, simmer until reduced to ⅓ cup (about 10-12 minutes), then remove from heat and whisk in butter and parsley.
6. Serve each cutlet on a plate, topped with sauce.
