# Author's Note

Starting junior year and having my own kitchen has sparked a real appreciation for our family recipes. A big thank you to everyone who sent in their recipes for my cookbook. Your contributions have helped me keep our family traditions alive in a simple, meaningful way.

This cookbook isn't just about food; it's a practical slice of our family heritage. I'm grateful for your part in it.
