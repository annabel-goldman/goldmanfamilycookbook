- ¼ cup Parmigiano Reggiano, grated

## Directions

1. Begin by heating the extra virgin olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil is heated, add the garlic cloves and cook until they turn light brown. Be vigilant and stir frequently to prevent burning.
2. Introduce the pesto and heavy cream to the pan. Stir occasionally and reduce the heat to low. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until it has thickened to your preference.
3. While the sauce is simmering, cook the tagliatelle pasta according to the instructions on the package.
4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the sauce in the pan. Follow this by adding the chopped basil, black pepper, salt, grated Parmigiano Reggiano, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Stir the mixture well, ensuring that the pasta is evenly coated. Taste and adjust the seasonings as necessary.
5. Serve the pasta hot, garnished with additional Parmigiano Reggiano. If desired, top with cooked chicken and pine nuts for added flavor and texture.
