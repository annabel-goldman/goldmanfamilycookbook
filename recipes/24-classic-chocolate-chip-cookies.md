**Recipe by Abby and Ryan Voggesser**

---

## Ingredients

- ¾ cup Butter Flavor Crisco
- 1¼ cups firmly packed light brown sugar

## Directions

1. Heat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine the Butter Flavor Crisco, light brown sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until the mixture is creamy.
3. Beat in the egg to the creamed mixture until fully incorporated.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda.
5. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture until just blended. Do not overmix.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips.
7. Drop rounded tablespoonfuls (about 2 measuring tablespoons) of dough 3 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes for chewy cookies (they will appear moist—do not overbake), or 11 to 13 minutes for crisp cookies.
9. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
