## Directions

### For the Pancakes

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. For extra fluffy pancakes, sift the flour twice.
2. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix until the batter is smooth.
3. Preheat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
4. Pour or scoop approximately ¼ cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until brown on both sides.
5. Serve the pancakes hot.

### For the Buttermilk Syrup

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, sugar, and buttermilk. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil.
2. Allow it to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.
3. Whisk in the baking soda and vanilla extract. The mixture will foam up; this is normal.
4. Serve the syrup warm over the pancakes.
