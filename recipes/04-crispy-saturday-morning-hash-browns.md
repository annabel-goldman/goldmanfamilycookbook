# Crispy Saturday Morning Hash Browns

**Recipe by Rob Goldman**

---

## Ingredients

- 3 russet potatoes
- Avocado oil (for frying)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Cheesecloth
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

---

## Directions

1. Peel the potatoes and grate them into a bowl of water mixed with the lemon juice. This prevents the potatoes from discoloring.
2. Drain the grated potatoes using a strainer or ricer, squeezing out as much water as possible.
3. Transfer the damp potato shavings onto a piece of cheesecloth. Firmly twist the cheesecloth to wring out any remaining water, aiming to get the shavings as dry as possible.
4. Heat avocado oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the potato shavings, pressing them down with a spatula to flatten.
5. Cook without disturbing for 4 minutes or until the bottom is golden brown.
6. Season the top with salt and pepper. Move the hash browns onto a plate.
7. Add another tablespoon or two of oil to the pan if needed. Return the hash browns to the pan and cook the other side until golden brown.
8. Transfer the finished hash browns to a plate lined with a napkin to absorb excess oil. Serve hot.
